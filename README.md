Hydrogen embrittlement represents a critical failure mechanism in metallic materials, significantly hindering the broader implementation of hydrogen-based energy technologies. To address this challenge, the current project introduces a peridynamic modeling approach specifically developed for simulating hydrogen embrittlement within the C++ based, open-source software called Peridigm, complemented by Python-based post-processing. This approach utilizes a two-parameter bond-based peridynamic theory, effectively overcoming inherent limitations associated with Poisson's ratio present in classical continuum mechanics.
    
The implemented model in Peridigm software is tested rigorously for its compatibility and stability in achieving the desired results. This covers unit-test, boundary condition test, mesh-convergence test, decoupling mechanical and diffusion kinetics, bond-failure analysis, time-step sensitivity analysis and crack-path prediction and crack propagation.

The developed model incorporates a tailored damage criterion designed explicitly to capture the critical influences of hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms. Through this formulation, the simulation effectively integrates hydrogen diffusion processes with resulting embrittlement effects. To validate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed peridynamic model, several rigorous test scenarios, particularly focusing on mode I crack propagation, are executed. The effectiveness and predictive capability of the model are determined based on the final contour
